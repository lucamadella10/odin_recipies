    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound lean beef</li>
            <li>2 jars of spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>6 ounces of cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
